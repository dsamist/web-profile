1. Install the most recent “istioctl” command from the tar file appropriate to your laptop architecture and move to a directory on your search path:
https://github.com/istio/istio/releases

2. Prepare to install Istio by following the “Provision OSS Istio via istioctl” sequence
on the page here:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservicesdemo/blob/main/kustomize/components/service-mesh-istio/README.md

3. Important note, in the command:
istioctl install --set profile=minimal -y, replace profile=minimal with profile=demo

# Enable sidecar injection for Kubernetes namespace(s) where the application is deployed
4. kubectl label namespace <namespaceName> istio-injection=enabled

NB: if your pods are already running before istio was deployed, you might not see the sidecar, hence, it is ok to delete the pod and when it is being recreated, you will noticed the sidecar is created along side as well

5. Install addons located in the monitoring/isito-master/samples directory
    kubectl apply -f addons/
